# test_json

Used to test that the [toJSON](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/ToJSON)
function works as expected both server and client-side.

The tests should be improved to include more JSON feature testing, including
[fromJSON](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/FromJSON).

Useful when updating the json-c vendor package in mtasa-blue to find
regressions.
