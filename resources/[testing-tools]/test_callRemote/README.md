# test_callRemote

Used to test that the [callRemote](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/CallRemote)
server-side function works as expected.

Useful when updating the curl vendor package in mtasa-blue to find regressions.

## Test endpoint

Some of the tests are calling a dedicated test endpoint, [curl-test-endpoint](/misc/curl-test-endpoint/).

Some of the tests are also calling localhost or [httpstat.us](http://httpstat.us).
